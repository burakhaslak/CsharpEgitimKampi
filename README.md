# My C# Training Camp Projects

This repository contains 10 foundational C# projects that I developed under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ. It was a learning journey where I reinforced programming concepts through projects and practical examples, starting completely from scratch. You can find the details of each project below.

📍 **Project 1: Main Subjects**
In this project, I learned how to print text to the console a work with variables in C#. I discovered the difference between Console.Write(), which prints on the same line, and Console.WriteLine(), which prints on a new line. Using string variables for customer information and int variables for product prices and quantities, I performed basic calculations and created a simple restaurant menu and order total program.

📍 **Project 2: Variables**
In this project, I learned to use string, int, double, and char variables.

  • Used string to store and display text such as names, surnames, and cities.

  • Used int to store integer values and perform calculations (e.g., product prices × quantity).

  • Used double for decimal numbers to calculate total prices and exam averages.

  • Used char for single-character data such as gender.

  • Learned to take user input with Console.ReadLine() and convert it to the correct data type using int.Parse() or double.Parse().

Through this project, I improved my ability to define variables, assign values, and handle user input effectively.

📍 **Project 3: Making Decisions**
In this project, I learned how programs make decisions using if-else and switch-case structures. I implemented password validation, exam result evaluation, and menu selection features based on user input. I also practiced handling special conditions using the modulo operator and char variables to produce different outputs.

📍 **Project 4: Loops**
In this project, I learned how to automate repetitive tasks using for and while loops. I applied loops to perform counting, summation, conditional filtering, and digit calculations. I also combined if statements within loops to control more complex conditions.

📍 **Project 5: Loops with Stars**
In this project, I learned to create shapes with stars using for loops. I designed line-by-line and side-by-side star patterns, right and inverted triangles, pyramids, and diamond shapes. By controlling rows and columns with nested loops, I reinforced my understanding of shape design logic.

📍 **Project 6: Arrays**
In this project, I learned the concept of arrays. I created string, int, and char arrays, assigned and retrieved elements, and used for loops to list all array elements. I practiced conditional selections and worked with array methods such as Sort, Reverse, IndexOf, Max, and Min. I also implemented summation, even/odd number checks, and search operations based on user input.

📍 **Project 7: Foreach Loops**
In this project, I accessed individual elements in arrays, lists, and strings using the foreach loop. I used it to print all elements sequentially, make conditional selections, and calculate sums easily. In a practical example, I built an exam application that stores student names and grades, calculates their averages, and determines pass/fail results.

📍 **Project 8: Value-Returning and Void Methods**
In this project, I learned to prevent code repetition and organize the program more efficiently by using methods. I created both void and value-returning methods for calculation and information display tasks. As a practical example, I wrote methods that take students’ exam grades and calculate their averages, simulating a real-world scenario.

📍 **Project 9: C# Database Product-Category Information System**
In this project, I worked with ADO.NET to interact with tables in SQL Server. I practiced fetching and listing data based on user-selected tables and temporarily storing them in memory using DataTable. Through this, I gained experience in implementing basic database operations with C#.

📍 **Project 10: Menu Order Processing Panel (Database CRUD Project)**
In this project, I implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on SQL Server using C#. I performed data insertion, listing, deletion, and updating based on user input. I also documented the process step-by-step with my own comments, gaining hands-on experience in database management with ADO.NET.


📍 **Project 11: Travel Statistics Panel**

In this project, I developed a **statistics panel** that queries information from a travel database using **Entity Framework** and visualizes the results through a **Windows Forms** interface.  
The goal of the project was to analyze data about tours, guides, and locations and present real-time statistics to the user. 💻

### 🔹 Key Features:
- Display of general information such as total number of locations, capacity, and guides.  
- Calculation of **average capacity** and **average tour price**.  
- Dynamic display of the **most recently added country**.  
- Querying capacity and guide data for specific cities (e.g., *Cappadocia*, *Rome*).  
- Identification of **the highest capacity** and **most expensive tours**.  
- Calculation of the number of tours managed by a specific guide (e.g., *Ayşegül Çınar*).  

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes:
- Built database connections using **Entity Framework** and performed filtering and data retrieval with **LINQ queries**.  
- Designed a **user-friendly Windows Forms interface** that visualizes dynamic statistics in a colorful, clear layout.  
- Managed **relational data** effectively by linking guide and location tables.  
- Improved **code readability** through consistent commenting and clean structure. 📊  
- Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in **database management**, **Entity Framework fundamentals**, and **interface design** in C#. I aim to expand these skills in more advanced future projects.
